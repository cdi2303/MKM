# BlogGPT - Laravel MVP (core files)
Below are the core files for the BlogGPT Laravel MVP. Copy each file into your Laravel project at the indicated path. This is a minimal, working scaffold: authentication (Laravel Breeze or Jetstream recommended) and additional hardening/validation are left for you to apply.

Quick start:
1. `composer create-project laravel/laravel bloggpt`
2. Copy files from this repo into the project (see file paths below).
3. `composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle`
4. Configure `.env` (DB, OPENAI_KEY etc.)
5. `php artisan migrate`
6. `npm install && npm run dev` (if frontend built)
7. `php artisan serve` or deploy to your server.
